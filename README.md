# Work of Art

Work of Art is an *experimental* implementation of the project of the course "Database Systems", that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, in 2015-2016.

## Status

As of the completion of the project, Work of Art will NOT be maintained, excluding, perhaps, rare document updates and tweaks if it becomes incompatible with newer software. The aim is to ensure its originality to the day it was delivered, despite its multiple flaws. By no means it should ever be considered stable or safe to use, as it contains numerous incomplete parts, critical bugs and security vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, note that the initial commits have been squashed to a single one, to make the repository more presentable to people that will show interest.

## Setup

Setting up Work of Art requires a significant amount of work. Please follow carefully the detailed instructions provided in [SETUP.md](/SETUP.md).
